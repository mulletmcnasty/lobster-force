# LOBSTER FORCE - Social Content Strategy

## Brand Voice

**Tone:** Confident, irreverent, authentic, working-class pride, slightly absurd but dead serious about it

**Language:** Blue-collar, direct, no corporate speak, lots of mullet/lobster puns

**Vibe:** Dive bar wisdom meets motivational poster. Part meme, part movement.
