# 🦞 LOBSTER FORCE

**Business in the Front. Party in the Back.**

The official crustacean coalition of the American mullet.

---

## What Is This?

Lobster Force is a movement celebrating the mullet lifestyle — the authentic, working-class, unapologetically weird spirit of America. We're not ironic. We're not hipsters. We're real people who rock real mullets and live real lives.

**Hard shells. Soft hearts. Legendary hair.**
