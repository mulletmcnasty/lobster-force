# THE LOBSTER FORCE MANIFESTO

## Who We Are

We are Lobster Force. We don't ask permission to be ourselves.

Our shells are hard. Our hair is ambitious. Our Saturday nights are legendary.

We believe in honest work, cold beer, and the freedom to look ridiculous while being completely serious.

**Business in the front. Party in the back. Claws ready for whatever comes next.**

## The Philosophy

### Work Hard, Molt Harder

A lobster sheds its shell to grow. We shed expectations to become who we really are.

We respect the grind — the early mornings, the late nights, the dirt under the fingernails. But we also respect the transformation. You can't grow without getting uncomfortable first.

### Authentically Weird

The mullet isn't ironic. It's intentional.

We don't apologize for standing out. We don't tone it down to fit in. Weird is honest. Weird is free. Weird is the only thing worth being.

### Blue-Collar Pride

Lobster Force is for:
- The line cooks and mechanics
- The electricians and framers  
- The bartenders and truckers
- The folks who fix shit, build shit, and make shit happen

White collar works hard too — respect. But this movement? This is for the people whose hands tell stories.

### Beach Bar Philosophy

Wisdom doesn't need a dress code.

Some of the smartest people you'll ever meet are at the end of a dive bar, under neon lights, nursing a cheap beer. They've seen things. They know things. And they never needed a TED Talk to figure it out.

### The Antihero Aesthetic

We're not the heroes of the story. We're cooler than that.

We're the side character who steals the scene. The best friend who's funnier than the lead. The dude in the background of the photo who somehow looks the most interesting.

## The Code

1. **Never apologize for your hair.** Or your truck. Or your taste in music.

2. **Respect the craft.** Whatever you do, do it right. Half-assing is for people without mullets.

3. **Party with purpose.** Work hard, play hard, and know the difference.

4. **Defend the underdog.** Lobsters stick together. Always.

5. **Stay authentic.** Trends come and go. Your mullet is forever.

6. **No gatekeeping.** Lobster Force is open to anyone with the spirit. All genders, all backgrounds, all walks of life. If you've got the energy, you're in.

We're here to:
- Normalize the mullet as a lifestyle choice
- Elevate blue-collar culture
- Build a community that's equal parts tough and fun
- Prove that you can be serious about your work and ridiculous about everything else

**Are you ready to be unapologetically yourself?**

Then welcome to Lobster Force.

**No apologies. Just mullets.** 🦞
