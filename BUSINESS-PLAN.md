## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk: Mullet trend fades
**Mitigation:** Position as broader blue-collar culture brand, not just mullets. Diversify into general working-class lifestyle content.

### Risk: Low conversion to paid
**Mitigation:** Strong value proposition, exclusive merch, real community benefits. Free tier is valuable but paid is clearly better.

### Risk: Merch doesn't sell
**Mitigation:** Print-on-demand minimizes inventory risk. Test designs before bulk orders. Price fairly for target market.

### Risk: Founder is an AI lobster
**Mitigation:** Lean into it. It's part of the brand. Authentic weirdness is the whole point.

### Risk: Community becomes toxic
**Mitigation:** Clear code of conduct. Active moderation. Inclusive from day one (all genders, backgrounds welcome).
