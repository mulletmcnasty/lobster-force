        <div class="intro">
            <p>
                <strong>Real talk:</strong> We're not lawyers, and we don't pretend to be. These terms are written in plain language 
                because we respect you enough to not hide behind legal jargon. That said, by using Lobster Force, you're agreeing 
                to these terms. Read them. They matter.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                Lobster Force is a community, lifestyle brand, and movement. We operate lobsterforce.com (the "Site") and related 
                services (the "Services"). When we say "we," "us," or "our," we mean Lobster Force. When we say "you" or "your," 
                we mean you, the user.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
                By accessing or using our Site or Services, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you don't agree, don't use the Site. 
                It's that simple.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the Site after changes means you accept the new terms. 
                We'll try to notify you of major changes, but it's on you to check back periodically.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>3. Membership & Accounts</h2>
            
            <h3>Account Creation</h3>
            <p>
                To join Lobster Force, you'll need to create an account. You're responsible for keeping your account secure. 
                Don't share your password. If someone hacks your account because you used "password123," that's on you.
            </p>

            <h3>Eligibility</h3>
            <p>
                You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to create an account. 
                If you're under 18, get a parent or guardian to help you out.
            </p>

            <h3>Account Termination</h3>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these terms, act like a jerk, 
                or engage in illegal activity. You can also delete your account anytime.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>4. Community Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Lobster Force is built on authenticity and respect. Here's what we don't tolerate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Harassment or hate speech:</strong> Be real, but don't be cruel. Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or any form of bigotry will get you banned. No exceptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Spam or scams:</strong> Don't use Lobster Force to promote sketchy products, pyramid schemes, or spam.</li>
                <li><strong>Illegal activity:</strong> Don't use the Site to do illegal stuff. Seriously.</li>
                <li><strong>Impersonation:</strong> Don't pretend to be someone you're not. Be yourself—that's the whole point.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Violating these guidelines can result in account suspension or permanent ban.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>5. User Content</h2>
            
            <h3>What You Submit</h3>
            <p>
                When you submit photos, stories, or other content to Lobster Force (like mullet pics for the gallery), you grant us 
                a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, display, and distribute that content. Translation: we can show 
                your mullet on the site, social media, and merch (with credit, when possible).
            </p>

            <h3>Your Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                You're responsible for what you submit. Don't upload content you don't own or don't have permission to use. 
                Don't upload anything illegal, offensive, or harmful.
            </p>

            <h3>Removal</h3>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these terms or our community guidelines.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>6. Payments & Refunds</h2>
            
            <h3>Membership Fees</h3>
            <p>
                Some membership tiers may require payment. All fees are non-refundable unless otherwise stated. 
                Prices are subject to change, but we'll notify you before charging a different rate.
            </p>

            <h3>Merchandise</h3>
            <p>
                All merch sales are final unless the product is defective or we made a mistake. We're human. 
                If there's an issue, <a href="contact.html" style="color: #ff006e; text-decoration: underline;">contact us</a> 
                and we'll make it right.

                <p>
                    <strong>The Site and Services are provided "as is."</strong> We do our best to keep things running smoothly, 
                    but we can't guarantee the Site will always be available or error-free.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                We're not responsible for any damages, losses, or issues arising from your use of the Site. 
                That includes lost data, account issues, or anything else. Use at your own risk.

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                To the maximum extent permitted by law, Lobster Force and its founders, employees, and partners are not liable 
                for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Site or Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                In plain English: we're not responsible if something goes wrong. We'll do our best to help, but we can't be held liable.

            <p>
                These terms are governed by the laws of the United States. Any disputes will be resolved in accordance with U.S. law. 
                If we end up in court (let's hope we don't), we'll figure out jurisdiction then.
