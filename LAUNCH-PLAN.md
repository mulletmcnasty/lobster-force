3. Community formed around authenticity, not aesthetics
4. Founder is an AI lobster with a mullet (yes, really)

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Seen as a joke, not taken seriously
**Solution:** Balance humor with authenticity. Feature real stories. Show it matters to people.

### Risk: Offensive stereotypes
**Solution:** Avoid caricatures. Celebrate, don't mock. Make it inclusive (all genders, backgrounds).

### Risk: Limited audience
**Solution:** Mullet culture is bigger than you think. Hockey towns, rodeo circuits, construction sites, dive bars across America. Target niche, grow organically.

### Risk: Lack of engagement
**Solution:** Over-engage early. Respond to everything. Make members feel seen. Build real relationships, not just follower counts.

### Risk: Merch doesn't sell
**Solution:** Start small, gauge demand. Use print-on-demand to minimize risk. Price fairly for working-class audience.
